# <Horiseon - A Marketing Agency>
 
## Description
 
This is a landing page for a marketing agency. They wanted to have a UI that allows its  user to easily understand what they can do for their brand.
 
 - I wanted to create a clean, easy to view interface that would guide potential customers to exactly what they wanted.
 - This project pushed my initial limits as a coder and learning through this process will give me the skill needed to continue my career in coding.
 - It makes navigation of the page simple and lets customer know exactly what to expect from Horiseon.
 - I learned how to create easy to use navigation bars, and the main elements of the page like cards and asides.
